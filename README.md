# RatsInSpace
RPG Simulator

## How to start the game:
- gradle run
- 
## Design Patterns
- The SpaceStation class uses the singleton pattern. It stores all of the floors generated in the game and the special top floor.
- The PCFactory uses the factory pattern. It creates a player character based on the userâ€™s input. The user can input a name and then select a character class and type. The PCFactory takes this data and creates player character which is then passed into the new game.
- The CycleFactory uses the flyweight factory pattern. I handles the creation and deletion of cycles, parts and floors as the user plays.
